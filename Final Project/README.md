## Real World Do Not Disturb Light

For anyone who's familiar with the concept of Deep Work, it can be very challenging to focus on a task at-hand with countless distractions around you. Whether you are in an office-space or working at a multi-member household, the cost of context switching is 25-minutes. While it may sound sensationalist, this massive cost can easily balloon into many hours of lost productivity per day. Tasks that should've taken 2 hours of focused work to complete can easily stretch into a full 8 hour workdays with enough random distractions from other people. Yet people continue to distract eachother in the workplace and in the household because they don't know any better. 

Companies are losing billions of dollars in lost productivity because of this. So what's the solution? Well, it's right here in my pocket.

It's a very simple device that can be thought of as a real-world status indicator or do not disturb light. But the key difference here is that it is fully automated, customizable, and designed to work completely from an app you already use..Google Calendar. Let's take a look.

Batching and creating focus blocks. But they challenge is, how does one accomplish this in the physical world?

In designing this device, I wanted it to look appealing on a desk and friendly to the user. It should not be intimidating, but rather inviting. I also wanted to make sure that the design was able to accomplish its task under a variety of circumstances. Low light performance, bright room performance, and across-the-room performance were all factors I considered. I knew I wouldn't be able to use the parts I already owned to accomplish this, so I sought out a bright LED array. I went for a 16x16 in order to give me enough resolution to draw custom shapes for the user without sacrificing on brightness. However, the LED array itself was actually too bright, so I added a charcoal diffusor to reduce eye strain and give ita  more polished appearance. 

### Materials Used
* Raspberry Pi 4
* Unicorn Hat HD (LED Display) w/ Light Diffusor
* Pimoroni Pibow Coupe (Enclosure)
* Adjustable Laptop Stand w/ Magnetic Mount
* USB-A to USB-C Cable
* Google Account


Documentation of design process
Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
Video of someone using your project (or as safe a version of that as can be managed given social distancing)
Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)
