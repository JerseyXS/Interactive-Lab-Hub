## Real World Do Not Disturb Light

For anyone who's familiar with the concept of Deep Work, it can be very challenging to focus on a task at-hand with countless distractions around you. Whether you are in an office-space or working at a multi-member household, the cost of context switching is 25-minutes. While it may sound sensationalist, this massive cost can easily balloon into many hours of lost productivity per day. Tasks that should've taken 2 hours of focused work to complete can easily stretch into a full 8 hour workdays with enough random distractions from other people. Yet people continue to distract eachother in the workplace and in the household because they don't know any better. 

Companies are losing billions of dollars in lost productivity because of this. So what's the solution? Well, it's right here in my pocket.

It's a very simple device that can be thought of as a real-world status indicator or do not disturb light. But the key difference here is that it is fully automated, customizable, and designed to work completely from an app you already use..Google Calendar. Let's take a look.

Batching and creating focus blocks. But they challenge is, how does one accomplish this in the physical world?
