## Real World Do Not Disturb Light

For anyone who's familiar with the concept of Deep Work, it can be very challenging to focus on a task at-hand with countless distractions around you. Whether you are in an office-space or working at a multi-member household, the cost of context switching averages to about 25-minutes. While it may sound sensationalist, this massive cost can easily balloon into many hours of lost productivity per day. Tasks that should've taken 2 hours of focused work to complete can easily stretch into a full 8 hour workdays with enough random distractions from other people. Yet people continue to distract eachother in the workplace and in the household because they simply do not know any better. Companies are losing billions of dollars in lost productivity because of this phenomenon. My project is an end-to-end solution to this productivity epidemic.

The project I built is a very simple device that can be thought of as a real-world status indicator or do not disturb light. The key difference here is that it is fully automated, customizable, and designed to work completely from Google Calendar. This design decision was made intentionally so that the user does not need to alter their workflows in order to benefit from the device. Right out of the gate, it will recognize if a user is busy and change its status accordingly.

In designing this device, I wanted it to look appealing on a desk and friendly to the user. It should not be intimidating, but rather inviting. I also wanted to make sure that the design was able to accomplish its task under a variety of circumstances. Low light performance, bright room performance, and across-the-room performance were all factors I considered. I knew I wouldn't be able to use the parts I already owned to accomplish this, so I sought out a bright LED array. I went for a 16x16 in order to give me enough resolution to draw custom shapes for the user without sacrificing on brightness. However, the LED array itself was actually too bright, so I added a charcoal diffusor to reduce eye strain and give ita  more polished appearance. 

The other factor I considered for the design was how it would be mounted. I did not think simply placing it on the desk would be appropriate. It is easy for people to not notice something on a desk until they are already too close. I recall back from a banking internship that employee name plates were placed directly on top of each employee's monitor to maximize intra-office visibility. This led me to seek out a monitor-mounting solution. After perusing Amazon, I came to the conclusion that a magnetic, monitor-mounted smartphone holder would serve this job extremely well. In order to place a magnet on the device, however, I needed an enclosure. This led me to the Pimoroni Coupe. What I really liked about this enclosure was that it could be assembled in layers. Since my LED array was so big, I needed to leave the outermost layer exposed. After assembling this partial enclosure, I was then abe to mount the device to my monitor in such a way that the power cable is completely hidden and daisy chained off of the monitors USB A ports.

### Materials Used

Documentation of design process
Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
Video of someone using your project (or as safe a version of that as can be managed given social distancing)
Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)
